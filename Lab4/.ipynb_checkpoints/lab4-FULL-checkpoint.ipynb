    "\n",
    "First, I just want to thank you for bringing me back to my senses and stopping my world domination attempt and silly startup idea. I don't know what happen, but I clearly wasn't myself there for a while. Now that you have brought me back to normal, I would like design this lab more similar to the first one and go through a topic that I find intriguing and ponder-worthy.\n",

    "This time, instead of looking around us, we will look inside. Ever since I arrived on this planet, I have been fascinated about your use of airborn oscillations to transmit information generated by electrical impulses. And the fact that you rely on muscular dexterity for the encoding process as well as passive mechnotransduction for the decoding is truly remarkable (in a primitive sense of course, I guess how your kind can appreciate \"the remarkable complexity\" of a cave painting). Such a system is clearly a bottleneck in terms of information bandwidth and I am surprised a more direct means of intercranial transmission never evolved here, but from the perspective of my research on less evolved galactic lifeforms I find this fascinating!\n",

    "After hearing that there are over 7,000 languages spoken across this globe, I am curious whether some of these at least allow for more rapid information transmission than others. The implications of this reach beyond just communication as I have recently learned that you also restrict many of your thoughts to those that can be expressed in words (again, fascinating!). This means that you could literally upgrade your thought throughput by learning a new language. And it could mean that there are groups of people who have access to faster thinking others, just because their language can convey information at a higher rate, what an enormous advantage!"

If you want to read part of the article, I recommend that you do it after attempting to answer the questions (or if you get stuck) since it will give away some of the things that we can otherwise \"discover\" ourselves.

The two variables that directly determine the information rate of a language are its information density (bits of information per syllable) and the rate at which it is spoken (syllables per second).

    "These results are looking pretty promising, now we just need to add a narrative so that it will be easy for others to follow along with what we have done here. Tell a story using the three plots we have created. Build it up according to the principles and examples from this week's required readings. In your story you can refer to the plots as plot A,B, and C. You story should make it clear what the plot is telling us and how it motivates the next plot we're making so that there is a clear story line for the reader to follow as well as a clear take home message (there might be many messages in these plots, so you can choose which to focus on). No need to write an essay here, a succinct paragraph per plot should do it.\n",

    "Examining plot A we can see that there is a positive linear trend between the amount of distinct syllables and the density of information conveyed of various languages per the continents of Asia and Europe. Within these respective language groups (by continent) we can see that as the number of distinct syllables of languages increases, so does the information density, in a linear fashion. There is one language belonging to the Europe cluster which deviates from this linear trend, having a much greater information density for its given syllables compared to other European languages.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "We move onto plot B and observe another linear trend within the language clusters of each continent, this time a negative linear trend. As the speech rate of the languages increase the density of information of the language decreases linearly compared to other languages in its respective continent. This implies that languages that speak faster need to in order to make up for the lack of information conveyed in their words. We do not see any languages both high in information density and speech rate, suggesting a maximum to the amount of info a human can communicate in a given time.\n",
    "  \n",
    "We move to plot C and observe the distribution of information rates (speech rate X information density) of all speakers per each language. We can see that the information rates between languages differ by mean rate from about 35 to 46 across the different languages. There does not appear to be any noticeable difference in info rate between the languages of different continents. There is also a large variation of info rate between speakers of a language suggesting possible variance in info rate between sub groups of languages"

    "- There is evidence that the words we have at our disposal influences how we think. This could mean that certain thought patterns and emotions might be more accessible in languages where they are more easily verbalized, and maybe we would have slightly different thoughts if we knew another language (the reference here is the weak form of the Sapiro-Whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity, not the strong version). After you are done with the lab, I recommend listening to [this talk by Lera Boroditsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKK7wGAYP6k) or watching the movie \"Arrival\" (although they go a bit far...) if you are interested in learning more about this (it's fun to think about!)."
